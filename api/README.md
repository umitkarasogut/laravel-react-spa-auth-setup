## Introduction

To get started, clone this repository and install its dependencies with `composer install`. Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and supply the URL of your frontend like so:

```
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

> Note: Currently, for this example, we recommend using `localhost` during local development to avoid "Same-Origin" issues.
